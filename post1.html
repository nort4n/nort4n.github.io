      <h1>Weekly notes: First Week</h1>
      <p>
        The first week of this course has concluded and the amount of concepts,
        tools and languages I have come in contact with feels already impressive
        to me.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Command Line</h3>
      <p>
        As a regular user of operating systems, may it be Windows, MacOS or
        Linux one is familiar with graphical user interfaces to access the
        functionality of ones system. Point and click, mostly. The command line
        is a universal tool predating GUis and can provide a powerful
        alternative access point in most circumstances. Eg. when working with
        vscode, one can simply open another tab with a command line; or while
        working with obsidian, have a shell open in a seperate window.
      </p>
      <p>#tools</p>
      <h3>Vim</h3>
      <p>
        Vim is simple and basic command line text editor that can be accessed on
        most systems. As a developer who wants to be able to work in most
        environments it makes sense to expose oneself with its basic
        functionality. The handling feels clumsy in the beginning (eg.
        understanding the concepts of insert, visual and command-line mode).
      </p>
      <p>#tools</p>
      <h3>Markdown</h3>
      <p>
        Markdown is simple and easy-to-use note markup language, that can
        display code, has operators for formatting etc. We use Obsidian to edit
        notes. With a web-based conversion tool like dillinger, markdown files
        get formatted to html quickly. Markdown is handy for text and content
        production and developer use it for documentation.
      </p>
      <p>#languages</p>
      <h3>Html and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Html is the language the web is based on. Its syntax is organized in
        elements that are specified by tags. It's open source, you can access
        the html-code of every page you visit via the browser. With the growing
        complexity in content and style and the professionalisation of web
        development, CSS ("Cascading Style Sheets") became standard. Formatting
        and styling of a web page are outsourced into a specific file, making it
        much more functional to apply changes on the whole page.
      </p>
      <p>#languages</p>
      <h3>VSCode</h3>
      <p>
        VSCode (Visiual Studio Code) is a powerful tool for html-editing,
        integrating git- and command line functionalities. A multitude of
        keyboard shortcuts make the developer's life easier and with the right
        theme, one truly starts feeling like a coder.
      </p>
      <p>#tools</p>
      <h3>Git</h3>
      <p>
        Git and Github are widely used tools and interfaces for project
        collaboration and version control. If you ever wondered, how several
        people manage to work on the same code, git is the answer. Code or
        project content is stored in a repository, i.e. a database containing
        the files and information on editing. There are local repos and remote
        repos; the former located with each developer, who works on his/hers
        before committing his/her changes and publishing them to the latter,
        which is stored on a server (mostly github).
      </p>
      <p>#collaboration</p>
      <h3>Miro</h3>
      <p>
        Miro is a mind mapping and brainstorming tool developed to enable
        collaborative mind maps. I was awe-struck when I first saw the cursers
        of each course participant amending the same mind map. Super useful to
        structure knowledge.

        <p>I’m starting a coding program and getting introduced to basic concepts
        of web development. In these pages I track my progress. I will
        demonstrate and practise what I’ve learned and expand the pages as I
        continue.

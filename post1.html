        <p>
          The first week of this course has concluded and the amount of concepts,
          tools and languages I have come in contact with feels already impressive
          to me.

        <h3>Command Line</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          As a regular user of operating systems, may it be Windows, MacOS or
          Linux one is familiar with graphical user interfaces to access the
          functionality of ones system. Point and click, mostly. The command line
          is a universal tool predating GUis and can provide a powerful
          alternative access point in most circumstances. Eg. when working with
          vscode, one can simply open another tab with a command line; or while
          working with obsidian, have a shell open in a seperate window.

        <h3>Vim</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          Vim is simple and basic command line text editor that can be accessed on
          most systems. As a developer who wants to be able to work in most
          environments it makes sense to expose oneself with its basic
          functionality. The handling feels clumsy in the beginning (eg.
          understanding the concepts of insert, visual and command-line mode).

        <h3>Markdown</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          Markdown is simple and easy-to-use note markup language, that can
          display code, has operators for formatting etc. We use Obsidian to edit
          notes. With a web-based conversion tool like dillinger, markdown files
          get formatted to html quickly. Markdown is handy for text and content
          production and developer use it for documentation.

        <h3>Html and CSS</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          Html is the language the web is based on. Its syntax is organized in
          elements that are specified by tags. It's open source, you can access
          the html-code of every page you visit via the browser. With the growing
          complexity in content and style and the professionalisation of web
          development, CSS ("Cascading Style Sheets") became standard. Formatting
          and styling of a web page are outsourced into a specific file, making it
          much more functional to apply changes on the whole page.

      <div class="blog-text">
        <p>
          VSCode (Visiual Studio Code) is a powerful tool for html-editing,
          integrating git- and command line functionalities. A multitude of
          keyboard shortcuts make the developer's life easier and with the right
          theme, one truly starts feeling like a coder.

        <p>
          Git and Github are widely used tools and interfaces for project
          collaboration and version control. If you ever wondered, how several
          people manage to work on the same code, git is the answer. Code or
          project content is stored in a repository, i.e. a database containing
          the files and information on editing. There are local repos and remote
          repos; the former located with each developer, who works on his/hers
          before committing his/her changes and publishing them to the latter,
          which is stored on a server (mostly github).

          Miro is a mind mapping and brainstorming tool developed to enable
          collaborative mind maps. I was awe-struck when I first saw the cursers
          of each course participant amending the same mind map. Super useful to
          structure knowledge.

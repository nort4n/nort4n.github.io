        <h1>Git</h1>
        <p>
      Git and Github are widely used tools and interfaces for project
      collaboration and version control. If you ever wondered, how several
      people manage to work on the same code, git is the answer. Code or project
      content is stored in a repository, i.e. a database containing the files
      and information on editing. There are local repos and remote repos; the
      former located with each developer, who works on his/hers before
      committing his/her changes and publishing them to the latter, which is
      stored on a server (mostly github).

            <p>I’m starting a coding program and getting introduced to basic concepts
            of web development. In these pages I track my progress. I will
            demonstrate and practise what I’ve learned and expand the pages as I
            continue.
